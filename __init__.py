"""
Maritime - a continuous-coordinate sailing and vessel simulation for Evennia.

Vessels are simulation entities holding a position in continuous world space.
Their interiors remain ordinary Evennia rooms, which move with the vessel rather
than determining where it is.

Commonly used names are re-exported here, so games can import them directly:

    from evennia.contrib.full_systems.maritime import GameTimeProvider
